Studio,"Well, the realistic sound and the customization tools. For me the speech rate is very important.","Sometimes you need to put emphasis on specific words like what we do when we talk. I think Azure has done quite well in getting the emphasis of words right. The best in the industry, in my opinion. However, it could become the wings for our dreams if the USER is given the complete control over what words should be pronounced with emphasis on. I mean, I'd like to customize it, and the current tools provided in Azure are far from enough.  
Oh, don't forget to provide better control on pauses too. The AI does a good job in deciding where and how long the pauses are, but sometimes customization is really needed. 
Thank you for your great products.",2,1,1,16,2
