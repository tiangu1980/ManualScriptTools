Studio,,"The text-to-speech batch synthesis API recently output a tone that was suddenly completely different from the past. The one I chose was: zh-CN-XiaochenNeural. I was unable to obtain technical support, which seriously affected my business;"
Studio,Its ease of use.,it's excellent.
Studio,Just started testing,Training on polyphonic characters needs to be strengthened
AzurePortal,,I am lost
AzurePortal,its cool,easier
AzurePortal,Range of features & relatively straightforward pricing,"It's frustrating having to apply to use some features, e.g. Personal Voice"
Studio,"Variety of voices, easy view of all files, export is user friendly",Would love some suggested intonations- or at least to make that easier bit more user friendly when creating  audio content
AzurePortal,,"I applied for a container on the edge, but I did not receive a reply."
AzurePortal,,Cool
AzurePortal,,divided into roles
Studio,easy handling,"If you select a speaker and then type a letter or word and then delete it again, the selected speaker will also be deleted. This is sometimes very annoying. Here it would be good if you had to press the delete key again to remove the speaker. This is particularly annoying when you want to start the sentence differently."
Studio,"There is a ""template"" setting, which can save a lot of actions.","Can the audio file downloaded from the file be named according to the content of the converted file?
You can keep the serial number in the front and add the converted content as the name."
AzurePortal,FUNCTION IS WONDERFUL,Speech Services IS PERFECT，HOWEVER I SPENT ALMOST ONE DAY TO FIND THIS SERVICE AND SET IT UP.
Studio,No,ok
AzurePortal,waiting,"I haven't used it yet, I'll give it a try first"
Studio,"Not sure, because I feel that its effect is not very stable. Sometimes the effect is very good, and sometimes it is weird.",I want to know how to choose a payment method. I called customer service but still don't understand
Studio,Rich voice library,More phonetic libraries for Cantonese
Studio,,My region is not supported for some of the most interesting and exciting new services.  The Eastern US shouldn't be excluded from innovation.
Studio,,personal voice not available
AzurePortal,anything,Not easy to handle.
AzurePortal,I don't know him yet,Not very easy for those who don't know the system
AzurePortal,so far nothing,I did not manage to carry out a single speech to text project
AzurePortal,natural speech,The processing of polyphonic Chinese characters needs to be improved.
AzurePortal,,i was trying to find my subscriptions to add speech services and it was the hardest thing to do.
Studio,,"I would like more voices, or more emotions in voices from Brazil (Portuguese-Brazil)"
Studio,,Very confusing information.
AzurePortal,,right now nothing
AzurePortal,,fine
AzurePortal,The quality of services is spectacular,Many clicks to do little.
AzurePortal,anything,tangled up
AzurePortal,"I have only used it for less than 5 hours so far, and it still needs time.","Can the file name of the downloaded file be the same as the content instead of the serial number?
For example, the first word of the converted file is apple
Then the downloaded file name should be 1.apple
Simply providing the serial number makes it difficult to know what the content is at a glance. You can only know it by clicking on it.
If I have 1,000 files to process, it’s impossible to click on them all."
Studio,Various options in Latin dialects,None by the moment
Studio,speed and ease,"not have western avatars.

Studio,Nothing right now.,Ability to upload a sample and try it not working.
AzurePortal,Fastest to choose.,Expensive it is!
AzurePortal,Powerful,Easy to use
AzurePortal,onomatopoeia,No experience yet
AzurePortal,Speed ​​of response,"When creating a Japanese custom speech model, the pronunciation data is not compatible.
In Japanese, even the same letters can have different pronunciations, so I would like this to be supported in Japanese as well."
AzurePortal,sound selectivity,This feature should be completely free rather than charged
Studio,many languages,none
Studio,,too expensive
Studio,,"I started using it very recently, I still haven't handled it enough to verify if it works correctly."
Studio,,crashes from time to time
Studio,,There's something wrong with Xiaochen's voice. It sounds very different from before.
AzurePortal,,Simple to set up and easy to use
AzurePortal,The audio,is very good
AzurePortal,Hhhjk,Mr
AzurePortal,anything,The setup is frustrating.
Studio,Simplicity.,Lack of Belarusian language
Studio,Be able to create it in a conversational format.,"I am dissatisfied with the fact that some voices have unnatural pauses and some voices have uncontrolled intonation. Also, it is incorrect that the stress of a compound noun is placed on the noun after it. Please improve the voice quality of British and Australian accents to match American ones."
AzurePortal,voice,Web page operation is too complicated
AzurePortal,,cannot move subscription
AzurePortal,,Too inconvenient
AzurePortal,"not really, the response seems slow to me",auto translate as well
AzurePortal,nothing,I just want to hear the voices. I'm 80 minutes in and not even heard a voice yet. Every other speech service you just click a link on the home page and hear examples. Yours... I have no clue no search got me there and I've now jumped through too many hoops. Even though I have free credits I will not be using this.
Studio,Sound quality,Need to make it faster. How can I do it.
Studio,The voice is the same as a real person,More intonation and tone
AzurePortal,,free
AzurePortal,,The cost is a tad prohibitive and it isn't super straight forward
Studio,ease of use,we need more voices in bulgarian!
AzurePortal,SSML is a great way to configure the voices. The SDK is easy to plug in.,Better ability to control the audio playback in the TypeScript SDK. How can we stop it sooner? How can we sync it with some visuals? Would like more realistic voice options like Whisper provides.
Studio,Very powerful.,Its hard to figure out how to add accents to my python script for the voices.  Not sure where to find it.
Studio,Powerful voice library,Overall feeling great
Studio,I don’t know if there are any test voices yet.,"I failed to upload the voice file. I have uploaded it multiple times. The interface interaction is not friendly to Chinese people and is worse than Apple. After successful registration, I cannot enter the interface to browse. When I came up, I was asked to bind a credit card."
Studio,,would be nice if the quality was good as evelenlabs
AzurePortal,,"Better, more accessible documentation"
AzurePortal,,The creation process is a bit cumbersome
Studio,intelligent,None yet
Studio,haven't been able to use it yet,how do get to use this? why can't you keep a recognizable end-point? and why is the URL embedded in the API itself?
Studio,,"[Education Edition] Whenever I need to use/try out certain resources, such as training custom voices, I need to create some resources first. There are a lot of cumbersome steps that make it difficult to use the service smoothly!"
Studio,,service too complicated
AzurePortal,,Can support speech synthesis in various local dialects
Studio,,Still in use
Studio,easy to use,More realistic voices
Studio,easy to use without much coding experience.,i would like more British accents with the realism and natural cadence/emphasis of the new US models
Studio,Ease of use,Difficulty finding the service page
Studio,How dang easy it is to use.,"Would LOVE to see closed caption timing for TTS.  I'm in education, and we need a transcript or captions for every audio element.  A standard closed caption file would be my 1st choice."
AzurePortal,Easy to use. The voices have a better quality than other services.,"The voice quality in Spanish is good but I think it should be improved even more to sound more natural and be clearer.
More granularity in the permissions and subservices within SpeechServices that are allowed access.
Include more tone of voice options in Spanish.
Transcription of text to speech in real time, to be able to use it as a reading service on the web pages of a portal."
AzurePortal,"No. For beginners, a bunch of unknown ""resources"" must be created before using all services, which is very annoying!","Before using the service, you need to create a bunch of ""resources"", but what are the differences and impacts of the various settings in the ""resources"", what are the restrictions on future use whether free or standard, whether the region further affects service access and usage rights, etc. The above officials do not provide information and teaching in advance."
AzurePortal,,containers are not functional to test in Lab
Studio,,Very good
AzurePortal,dgd,fgfg
Studio,language ease and speaker fluency,"The configuration should be more practical, I spent 20 minutes trying to get to the application"
Studio,,"Using TTS in Greek, some words will randomly be pronounced with their first letter as the name of the letter and then the rest of the word"
Studio,It will be all right,Hope there are more Chinese voices
AzurePortal,,After doing all setup i was told i dont have access. What stupid system you have.
Studio,I think the speech studio is a nice way to organize and modify speech scripts.  Although the flow could be a little smother and more intuitive.,"I'd like the speech to be a little more natural and provide options for a chuckle, laugh, sigh and like emotional expressions."
AzurePortal,,Service does not work properly
AzurePortal,,Accessing the website is so slow
Studio,easy to use,more of the better voices
Studio,Easy to use. I mainly use text-to-speech.,It would be nice to have a keyboard shortcut for Play in the Speech Studio.
Studio,"Love that the UI is clean, simple and intuitive and that I have access to my files at all times.

The speech quality is also the best I have been able to find.","Using the different styles often makes the voice sounds like it belongs to a completely different person.

Applying intonation can be fiddly at times if there is also variations in speech rate applied. Hard to select just the right section.

Would like option for breathing sounds / staggered breath.

Rythm parameter. I find I have to manually add a lot of speech rate variations to make it sound more natural or achieve certain effetcs. Would be a huge time saver if this could be automated.

Loudness/force parameter - the volume is simple turning the volume up and down and doesn't imitate someone speaking software / louder.

keyboard shortcuts - way too much clicking around with the mouse!

Saving presets as characters. When creating narrations with a single voice that is supposed to imitate different characters this would be handy. Google has a nice way of doing this in their new auto narration service (although the quality of that is pretty bad)."
Studio,Possibility to have different voices in one request,Quality of voices can be better.
Studio,your free services,I can't understand the documentations
Studio,todooooooooo,more voices in Spanish =)
Studio,saves time,"pronounce acronyms properly
preset of words that you use frequently
""predictive"" text/text suggestions?"
Studio,The sound quality is ahead of its peers,Cumbersome operation
Studio,,It's not working.  Just showing 401 auth errors.  No alternative using CLI.
Studio,,Not working - showing 401 errors
Studio,,Too slow
Studio,,System crashes often occur when using it.
AzurePortal,,cumbersome
AzurePortal,I'm watching,Anything
AzurePortal,it allows me to talk with my ai,unppealing
AzurePortal,Relative ease of use,The relatively high price for using the speech synthesis service is frustrating. Preferably free
AzurePortal,ease of use,more voices in Portuguese
AzurePortal,,"It has suddenly stopped working completely. I have thousands of users who can no longer use my product, because for some reason your service no longer works - yet does not provide any errors or indications that it is not working. I have not changed anything in my product, but suddenly the entire speech to text service does not work. My users noticed before I did. I will potentially switch to AWS because of this as it is a very serious issue and it is may in fact ruin my products reputation."
Studio,,Adapt to more browsers
Studio,"Good voices, very natural.",Clearer help.
Studio,A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING,MORE CHARACTERS IN THE AUDIO
AzurePortal,anything,I couldn't even test it
Studio,quality,I am missing download capability of training data.
AzurePortal,,Text-to-speech is real
Studio,,Character total is inaccurate
Studio,The best among all the TTS services I have tried.,"The intonation is hard to adjust. There are lots of misplaced stresses which is really hard to correct using current tools. If there is a way to mark wich word/words should be stressed and the TTS just follow that pattern, that would be so much better."
Studio,"text-to-speech, voice cloning","There are more character voices to choose from, and more different voice styles."
Studio,"which is free, the quality is higher than the voices I already had before.","The comma (,) and the semicolon (;) and the colon (:) are pronounced identically, and are different signs. It took me forever to replace the semicolons (;) with periods (.), for the audio to make sense.

The columns still cannot be modified in size or width; It would also be good to be able to remove columns that you do not use.

Sometimes it gives strange errors, which you don't know what they are, the other day he told me that I went over the quota; and because of that, he couldn't continue synthesizing. and then at 11pm it started working again.

There are words that he pronounces incorrectly, he pronounces them in English, instead of pronouncing them in Spanish; for example: basal. For it to be pronounced correctly, I have to write it with a short v: vasales; and there he pronounces it well.

the lexicon/dictionary or pronunciation rules are impossible to use; For example, these voices mispronounce: Freud, Lacan.
It is so complicated to change the pronunciation of a word, that I prefer to pronounce them wrong."
Studio,It allows us to generate a certain amount of content that other services offer in a very expensive way,"So far the text-to-speech generation is quite interesting, I tried it and I think it is an exceptional function for creating educational content for communities. like videos or presentations"
Studio,Speech Studio is free,"New, more natural and less robotic voices"
Studio,stop asking,stop asking
AzurePortal,its ease of use,so far nothing
Studio,tts function,generate srt
Studio,have a future. Voice aspect.,More Kazakh vocals
AzurePortal,Voice service,More vocals
AzurePortal,,no fearful  voices inenglish
Studio,,very easy to use
Studio,flexibility and SSML editing,Slow response times
AzurePortal,Simply easy to use and stable.,"I would like something to be done about the inability to recognize phrases that include Japanese kanji with special pronunciations.
For example, no matter how hard I try, I can't get it to recognize ``Kasane Teto.''"
Studio,"The sound quality, the choice of voices, the prices. The possibility of being able to listen before starting production.","Good morning. Your service is very good. Only small criticism is that sometimes the phonetic connection in the numbers (especially 8 and 10 pronounced hui and di) Otherwise price-wise, it is much more affordable than an eleven labs. Thank you."
Studio,,no auto language detection or setting
Studio,Most of the voices sound great.,"Adjust inflection of a certain word is a bit frustrating. Also, preview voices only available in the East and not the West is annoying."
Studio,anything,terrible
Studio,that exists,The system is slow and lacks server resources. I spend my time noticing its unavailability...
AzurePortal,Voice,Hola
Studio,natural sound,It is hoped that a new virtual character anchor and voice will be added.
Studio,That the translation is 85% usable,"recognize the names of municipalities, states, geographical names. Truncated Beginnings. . ."
Studio,,A bit expensive……
AzurePortal,I tried it on a recording from a mobile radio and was surprised how accurate it was.,Async callbacks seems a bit cumbersome when processing recordings. The quickstart documentation should at least have some suggestions about it. I ended up figuring it out with some help from Stack Overflow.
Studio,the clarity of the voice,"that the voices in Spanish become even closer to human voices, including intonation in different states of emotion, how to describe fear, crying, pain, sadness"
Studio,Natural and adjustable.,Nothing yet. Anticipate learning how to modulate the speech desired.
Studio,"Human speech is highly accurate and can be transcribed from audio. In multiple meetings, the accuracy decreases, but I think it can't be helped.","①If you have a choice of business field and specialty, I think they will suggest appropriate words. ② Since the sentences are written in kanji by force from the surrounding sentences, you can use hiragana if that is not possible. ③I would like to see the option of whether or not to delete filler words such as uh and uh."
AzurePortal,,Chinese translation is not accurate enough
Studio,"The quality of the voices, and the generous 500 000 free characters per month tts","The web UI can be a bit janky. Sometimes refusing to save, which stops me from exporting."
AzurePortal,free,free

,,too slow to load
,,"I haven't started exploring it yet, and I will make a fair evaluation after learning more about it."
,,I can’t set the tone and pitch to a constant baseline using code. I have to send the mark up each time and I wish I could just save the edited version from on here as a separate voice I use.
,,Improved (natural) voices
Studio,Where Avatar Service provides explanations on your behalf,Nothing in particular.
,Choices of voice talents,Recommended
Studio,ease of use,SO FAR SO GOOD
Studio,mega wow,would be nice if i can point it to a page and it can give me a list of discovered audio files with checkboxes to choose to use as source or not.
Studio,Text-to-speech is effective,Mandarin characters in text-to-speech services sometimes have inaccurate pronunciation
Studio,"Each voice has different emotions to choose from, and users don’t need to adjust them themselves.","There are too few types of voices, only a few with perfect voices, girls (like Xiaoxiao) and young boys (Yunxi) who lack the sweet voices. Add a mode to import the manuscript of the speaker who has been prepared."
AzurePortal,,The steps are too cumbersome and too many. I hope they can be simplified.
Studio,,"Text-to-speech, part of the speech is synthesized. I exported and converted it under the SO fee link for more than ten hours without success. I don’t know if it will be charged."
AzurePortal,,Often unresponsive
Studio,,"when intoning parts of the text, if I want to change this intonation, I have to click on the exact same range of text, which is sometimes problematic"
AzurePortal,,"The creation is too complicated to get started, so why not just hang it out and let everyone subscribe and use it."
AzurePortal,,"The sound is still a bit stiff, not user-friendly enough, and the price is too expensive"
AzurePortal,I haven't tried it yet,VERY COMPLICATED! I CAN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING!! PLEASE MAKE THIS PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PROFESSIONELS LIKE US!
Studio,Customization with phonemes is cool. A phoneme can be translated into another language.,Improvement in file handling. Copy with rename is missing.
AzurePortal,practicality,Could create subtitles for videos in *.str file
,Once you can get pass the initial set up it is easy to use,"Kind of hard to get started without a walk through, I was lucky to find a video that could get me to use the service via YouTube. I feel this should have better instructions on how to start creating files, it is not very intuitive."
Studio,there are options to choose from,It works very well
Studio,Professional level,More virtual human images
Studio,Strong function,"Not very convenient, the learning time for the first contact is a bit long"
Studio,Powerful functions and realistic sound,"The function is too complex, AI chatbot."
AzurePortal,,Complicated to set up. not intuitive
AzurePortal,,I don't understand how to use it
AzurePortal,,requires technical patience and knowledge to use it. very complex
AzurePortal,,Too cumbersome
AzurePortal,,There is no complete Chinese explanation
AzurePortal,,Hope to see more characters and more emotions
Studio,,It's frustrating the way resources are entered and created.
AzurePortal,,good
Studio,,"How can I report something wrong with the TTS conversion results? For example, ""佛"" is pronounced as ""fu 2"" instead of ""fo 2"" when Voice profile ""Yunze"" of Mandarin Chinese is selected. I also came across quite a few similar errors before. (I tried the Pinyin correction tool in the sidebar, but it turns out to be the correct Pinyin but wrong pronuciation. Weird.) I hope to help improve it. But I don't know if there is a more convenient way of sending feedback to you. I hope there is a better and quicker way of submitting errors like this, so they get resolved more quickly. Thank you for your great products."
AzurePortal,at the moment not much besides the fact i can use it,There is a lot going on maybe making it more simple for people that struggle with technology
Studio,Easy to use,Much more characters and control over their expressions and movements
Studio,"It has good customization. I would appreciate if it has the option to download the transcription, I did not see it",It was not perfectly clear for me which scenario to choose when I simply want to upload a file and transcribe it.
Studio,stop,"stop asking for endless feedback , its so annoying"
AzurePortal,I think the $200 monthly limit is my favorite,very nice! !
Studio,Text-to-speech is faster.,"Wish there were more sound options. When downloading audio, you can download the corresponding subtitles"
Studio,like it all,No
AzurePortal,,I cannot understand how it works
Studio,,it is too complex and difficult to deploy the service
AzurePortal,,its not easy to understand
AzurePortal,,super hard to find what i need to do
Studio,,Too robotic.
Studio,,There is no server in China and it is slow to use.
AzurePortal,,"The registration threshold is high, just use ordinary domestic debit cards."
Studio,,"Because it is an integrated service, it is too complicated for people who only want to use a single function."
AzurePortal,,Let me finish the registration be fore the Feedback popup
Studio,,The sound quality when played with a good audio system is poor
Studio,,"I wish all of the voices had different options, not just the default."
Studio,Many things that can be configured,It is very good but they could improve the quality of the voices in Spanish to beat Elebenlabs
Studio,quality voices. Intonation. Emotions. Ease of revision. A lot to love,it's great. Amazon polly has some voices for longer narrations that are nice. Something like that might help.
Studio,"Well, the realistic sound and the customization tools. For me the speech rate is very important.","Sometimes you need to put emphasis on specific words like what we do when we talk. I think Azure has done quite well in getting the emphasis of words right. The best in the industry, in my opinion. However, it could become the wings for our dreams if the USER is given the complete control over what words should be pronounced with emphasis on. I mean, I'd like to customize it, and the current tools provided in Azure are far from enough.  
Oh, don't forget to provide better control on pauses too. The AI does a good job in deciding where and how long the pauses are, but sometimes customization is really needed. 
Thank you for your great products."
AzurePortal,many choices,More diverse languages ​​and naturalness
AzurePortal,Text-to-speech is currently the closest to human voice,I hope there will be some more scenes of chatting and poetry reciting in the Chinese section.
Studio,,Where's dark mode?
AzurePortal,,I'm still testing
Studio,More Natural,Please add more voices selection
AzurePortal,UI and free services,"Yes, the UI is very intuitive and clear

AzurePortal,Nothing since I didn't test it yet,"I DID NOT HAVE TIME YET TO EVALUATE; WHY DO YOU ASK ME NOW? I can't recommend something that I havent fully tested yet. Ask users when they deploayed a few requests, lol. Didn't intend to scream at you, sorry."
Studio,"Fast, accurate recognition, beautiful synthetic voices. Now foreign words or Germanized English terms can also be pronounced correctly.",That I wasn't allowed to synthesize my voice ;)
AzurePortal,voice over talent,Not much choices
Studio,"The voice quality is very good, it would be better if it was cheaper.","There should be an interface/or structured document to list all characters/voice characteristics/emotional characteristics. I don't know why I couldn't find it, or the entrance and help documents are not obvious."

Studio,Good for Education.. students love it,Love this option...its very advanced
AzurePortal,I like the free use of some services especially for students.,"being able to use custom speech using personal use or email. 
I would like to use for myself speaking because I have trouble speaking."
AzurePortal,Voice quality,I haven't tested enough yet
Studio,Nothing. It doesn't work,"It doesn't work. I am the administrator of the account, I created the Speech resource, but when I try to do the text to speech, it just says I don't have access to the voice list. Fix it. 
Also, you don't support wake words in javascript, which is immensely frustrating, and will probably force us to go with another provider."
Studio,That allows people to try your products,Excellent
AzurePortal,Easy to use and quick to deploy resources,It's quick and easy to use and very easy to use; but it can be pricey. I hope I can customize my virtual image
AzurePortal,Convenient,More concise function introduction
Studio,natural voice,More diverse voices
Studio,,can't manage files although I'm the owner of the speech resource

AzurePortal,ok,good
Studio,several editing options,voice is a bit robotic today there are ultrarealistic voices on the market....there are already several websites with ultrarealistic voices..look at https://play.ht/
AzurePortal,Its own performance is okay,It's complicated to use
AzurePortal,Powerful,"There are too few sops, making it difficult for novices to get started."

AzurePortal,Transcribe has relatively high accuracy,Automatically select region
Studio,trying to play and think of possible outcomes,more options of customizing the voices in the studio to try and get desired output and pick up the setting of the created voice from studio.
Studio,,I haven't even tried it yet and you have quizzed me three times.
Studio,Text dubbing is powerful,"In a mixed context of Chinese and English, the English abbreviations of some proper nouns are different from the way the words are read, so there is no need to spell them out. I hope that the English abbreviations can be more conveniently notated and read more naturally."
Studio,,"I have an admin account - the only account in my organization, yet I can't access the service as I get ""You do not have access level for this service."" The entire onboarding and setup process has crashed at every stage so far, which has never happened while setting up AWS or Google developer consoles. Based on this experience it's impossible to recommend Azure."
Studio,,Too clumsy for a long text.
AzurePortal,,Dont know
AzurePortal,,keeps crashing needs to provide pictures for instructions
AzurePortal,I love that there are so many free voices!,I would like to see long for recording for voices
AzurePortal,Your voice to text service,They ask for too much information
